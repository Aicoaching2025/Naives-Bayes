# ðŸŽ¨ README: Naive Bayes Spam Detection

Welcome to the **Naive Bayes Spam Detection** repository! This project demonstrates how to apply the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails as either "Spam" or "Not Spam." Below, youâ€™ll find details on setting up the project, running the code, and interpreting the resultsâ€”specifically the confusion matrix.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that works particularly well with text data. By assuming feature independence, it provides quick and reliable performance, even on large datasets. In the realm of email filtering, Naive Bayes helps identify spam emails by analyzing features such as word frequencies or keyword presence.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

1. **Simplicity:**  
   Easy to implement and understand, making it a great starting point for beginners.

2. **Efficiency:**  
   Handles large datasets efficiently, an essential requirement for Big Tech environments where millions of emails are processed daily.

3. **High-Dimensional Data Handling:**  
   Excels in text classification tasks where each word can be treated as a separate feature.

4. **Adaptability:**  
   Can be updated easily with new training data, keeping pace with evolving spam tactics.

## ðŸ’» Code Example

Below is a simplified example of how Naive Bayes can be used to classify emails. In this demo, we simulate email features and labels for illustration purposes.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay

# Simulated features for emails (e.g., frequency of spam-related keywords)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # Two dummy features representing email characteristics
y = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=100)  # 0: Not Spam, 1: Spam

# Train the Naive Bayes classifier
nb = GaussianNB()
nb.fit(X, y)
y_pred = nb.predict(X)

# Compute and display the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y, y_pred)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=['Not Spam', 'Spam'])
disp.plot(cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Naive Bayes Confusion Matrix for Spam Classification')
plt.show()
